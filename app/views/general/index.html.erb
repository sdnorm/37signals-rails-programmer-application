          Hello there! I'm a seasoned Rails programmer with over 8 years of experience in breathing 
          life into both new and old applications. My philosophy? Scrappy and detail-oriented, 
          I excel at rapidly deploying viable solutions as a starting point, then rigorously refining them through iterations. 
          Rails has been my trusty sidekick, helping me handle hefty workloads that I didn't think I could, 
          and allowing me to ship code that I'm proud of.

          Off the keyboard, in true southern fashion, I embrace the charm of fishing but truly come alive on the golf course. 
          Golf isn't just a sport for me; it's a mental puzzle where each swing and round differs, feeding 
          my love for detail and strategy. While sometimes, just griping it and ripping it and seeing what happens. 
          Plus, it's the perfect 'excuse' to spend quality time outdoors, 
          nerding out over trajectories and wind speeds while spending quality time with my kids and friends.

        I have admired 37signals from afar, seeing it as a benchmark for outstanding company management. To me, 37signals is the
        standard bearer of how to run a company effectively and thoughtfully. I understand that various situations require different 
        organizational methods and operational approaches. Yet, the philosophies guiding 37signals, from its daily operations 
        to its long-term approach sans goals, deeply resonate with me. I connect profoundly with the vision and principles that 
        drive this remarkable organization.

        In a recent interview, David emphasized the importance of not only standing out in a cover letter or phone conversation 
        but also proving one's coding capabilities. Taking this to heart, I decided to get a head start by showcasing my skills 
        through actual code. I’ve implemented a couple of features listed in the “things we’ve recently worked on” section, 
        such as an NLP date parser and a QR code session transfer feature. You can see these in action by <%= link_to "signing up", 
        new_registration_path, class: "text-blue-500" %>, and you can see the 
        <%= link_to "code here", "https://github.com/sdnorm/37signals-rails-programmer-application", class: "text-blue-500", target: "_blank" %>, 
        offering a peek into how I might contribute in the role at 37signals.
