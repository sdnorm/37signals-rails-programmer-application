          Hello there! I'm a seasoned Rails programmer with over 8 years of experience in breathing life into both new and old applications. 
          My philosophy? Scrappy and detail-oriented, I excel at rapidly deploying viable solutions as a starting point, then rigorously refining them through iterations. 
          Rails has been my trusty sidekick, helping me handle hefty workloads that I didn't think I could, and allowing me to ship code that I'm proud of.

          Off the keyboard, in true southern fashion, I embrace the charm of fishing but truly come alive on the golf course. Golf isn't just a sport for me; 
          it's a mental puzzle where each swing and round differs, feeding my love for detail and strategy. While sometimes, 
          just gripping it and ripping it and seeing what happens. Plus, it's the perfect 'excuse' to spend quality time outdoors, 
          nerding out over trajectories and wind speeds while spending quality time with my kids and friends.

        I admire companies that prioritize thoughtful management and operations. I understand that various situations require different organizational methods and operational approaches.

        In a recent conversation, it was emphasized the importance of not only standing out in a cover letter or phone conversation but also proving one's coding capabilities. 
        Taking this to heart, I decided to get a head start by showcasing my skills through actual code. Iâ€™ve implemented a couple of features that demonstrate my ability to contribute effectively. 
        You can see these in action by <%= link_to "signing up", new_registration_path, class: "text-blue-500" %>, and you can see the 
        <%= link_to "code here", "https://github.com/sdnorm/profile-site", class: "text-blue-500", target: "_blank" %>, 
        offering a peek into how I might contribute in a similar role.
